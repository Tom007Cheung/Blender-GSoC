* TODO Synopsis

* Benefits
  More user-friendly and powerful outliner.

* TODO Deliverables

* Project Details [3/6]
  The major code is in /source/blender/editors// *space_outliner* && *space_view3d*
 path.
  - [X] Shift-select to select a range of items.\\
    It is related to *tree's traversal* problem,
  - [ ] Box selection by simple click and drag.
  - [X] Shortcut keys for operations like delete, duplicate.\\
    *Keybinding* Sequence(meta keys)
    - *M1*: This is the /Delete/ key
    - *M2*: This is the /Shift/ key
    - *M3*: This is the /Ctrl/ or /command/ key
  - [ ] Arrow key navigation.
  - [ ] More consistent and powerful right-click menus.
  - [X] Sync selection between 3D viewport and outliner.\\
    This has higher priority than the 1st item. 
    We only need one way to show selections - the highlighted row.
* Project Schedule
  I could finish this project in 12 weeks, and about 1 item per 2 weeks.

* Bio
  My name is Yadong Cheung, I live in China.
Currently studying at East China Normal University(ECNU).
I major in preschool education, UI design is my hobby, and I love 3D modules especially in animals.
The first time that I know CG is the interdisciplinary course /The Film and Television Direct/ 
I studied, which needed pecial effects modeling. HTML and CSS is based on web and it's designed for
front-end engineer, maybe they could be helpful of outliner designing, I also started learning $\TeX$, the perfect
typesetting system, last year. 

** Programming experience
I like *C* language, and although I have no experience in products but I read the two books which are konwn as
 *The C Programming Language* /2e/ and
*C Primer Plus* /6e/. I used to programming in XCode and Eclipse.
I learned *Python* from edx, which course is
 [[https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-0][Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python]].
