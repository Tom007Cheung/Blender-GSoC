  My name is Yadong Cheung, I live in China.
Currently studying at East China Normal University(ECNU).
I major in preschool education, UI design is my hobby, and I love 3D modules especially in animals.
The first time that I know CG is the interdisciplinary course /The Film and Television Direct/ 
I studied, which needed pecial effects modeling. I also started learning $\TeX$, the perfect
typesetting system, last year.
